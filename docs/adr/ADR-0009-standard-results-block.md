- The footer must be the orange (`\e[38;5;208m`) block with these exact lines: `==== RESULTS ====`, `<fields>`, `==== END RESULTS ====`.
- Only include these fields when present: `KubeContext`, `Namespace`, `Deployments`, `Services`, `Ingresses`, `Pods`, `Health checks`, `Samples`.
- Do not emit any text after the footer block.
